"""Q-Rating math.

Pure functions only - no DB, no I/O. Everything here is deterministic and
directly unit-testable; the DB writer lives in rounds_service.finalize_round().

Two paths compute a rating change:

  * peer       - Codeforces-style seed model. Your expected finishing place is
                 predicted from the ratings of everyone else in the round; you
                 gain or lose by beating or missing it. Needs a real field to
                 mean anything.
  * difficulty - each task is an opponent rated at its own difficulty; solving
                 is a win, not solving is a loss. Used when the field is too
                 small for the peer model, and always used for pillar
                 sub-ratings.

"""Qplanner goal presets -- the "named plan" intake model (see PLANS/qplanner.md).

Hardcoded module constant, matching roadmap_seed.SEED_TOPICS' convention: this is
reference data that ships with the code, not user content, so it needs no
collection and no seeding step.

`default_weekly_minutes` / `default_weeks` are sized against the real seeded
roadmap (quantum-maths 7.8h + quantum-physics 8.2h, quantum-computing 39.6h,
all five domains 111.1h) so the intake form opens on a feasible combination.
The learner can move both, and qplanner_schedule.feasibility() recomputes the
truth either way -- these are starting points, not constraints.
